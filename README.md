# Single Landing Page (CRA with twin + styled-components)

This is the project from bradtraversy's styled components crash course.
I've learnt how to implement some Frontend skills like 'styled-component' from this course. (https://github.com/bradtraversy/huddle_styled_components.git)

Plus, I want to rebuild this project with another styling approach using 'tailwinCSS + tw.macro + styled-components'.
